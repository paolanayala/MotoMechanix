# MotoMechanix
Vehicle builder CLI using Typescript, Module 8

**Description** 

MotorMechanix is a starter TypeScript-based command-line application that allows users to build and interact with different types of vehicles, including cars, motorbikes, and trucks. Users can create vehicles with specific attributes and simulate different functionalities such as starting the vehicle, loading cargo (for trucks), and more. This project showcases how TypeScript's powerful features can be used to manage different vehicle types.

**Motivation**

The motivation behind this project was to gain deeper knowledge of how to apply TypeScript and improve my skills in designing an application that handles different object types. I wanted to challenge myself by building a command-line interface tool that can simulate real-world objects (like vehicles) and provide flexibility for future additions, including new features and vehicle types.

I built this project to explore Typescript's potential for handling object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance. It also helped me learn to build a robust command-line tool that can interact with users through well-structured input/output. Ultimately, I learned to develop a practical, expandable app that can be extended with new features like different vehicle categories and other functionalities. 

While building this, I learned how to implement concepts such as inheritance and abstraction using Typescript, allowing me to manage different types of vehicles effectively. I also learned to design a system that easily extends the project by adding new vehicle types and functionalities.

**Future Additions**

In the future, I plan to add more vehicle types such as buses, boats, and planes. I'd also like to include further features such as distance traveled and fuel consumption.
